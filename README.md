### Hi there, I'm Sudat (he/they)! 👋

I'm an undergraduate astrophysics student @ Stony Brook University (Department of Physics and Astronomy) 🔭. Currently I am focusing on computational fluid dynamics with specific applications to protoplanetary disk and planet formation simulations. I also love doing N-Body simulations!
