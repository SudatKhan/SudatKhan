### Hi there, I'm Sudat (he/they)! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a (rising) graduate astrophysics student (Ph.D) @ University of Nevada, Las Vegas (Department of Physics and Astronomy) ðŸ”­. Currently, I am focusing on computational hydrodynamics/MHD with specific applications to protoplanetary disk and planet formation simulations. I also love doing N-body simulations!
